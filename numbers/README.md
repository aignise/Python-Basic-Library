# Numbers Module

The `numbers` module encompasses a wide range of operations and manipulations related to numbers in Python. It offers a collection of functions, each focusing on a specific operation, ensuring modularity and ease of use.

## Files & Descriptions

### 1. `arithmetic.py`
- Basic arithmetic operations.
    - `add(a, b)`: Sum of two numbers.
    - `subtract(a, b)`: Difference between two numbers.
    ... (similar descriptions for other functions in this file)

### 2. `conversion.py`
- Converting between different numerical types and strings.
    - `int_to_float(n)`: Convert an integer to a float.
    - `float_to_int(f)`: Convert a float to an integer.
    ... (similar descriptions for other functions in this file)

### 3. `comparison.py`
- Comparing two numbers.
    - `is_equal(a, b)`: Check if two numbers are equal.
    - `is_greater_than(a, b)`: Check if `a` is greater than `b`.
    ... (similar descriptions for other functions in this file)

### 4. `statistics.py`
- Basic statistical operations on a list of numbers.
    - `mean(numbers)`: Calculate the mean of a list of numbers.
    - `median(numbers)`: Determine the median of a list of numbers.
    ... (similar descriptions for other functions in this file)

## Usage

To use any function from the `numbers` module, simply import the desired function and call it in your code. For example:
```python
from numbers.arithmetic import add
result = add(10, 5)  # returns 15
```

For more extensive operations and use-cases, consider exploring Python's built-in modules like `math` and `statistics`.
